"Since our first release of FreeBSD 1.0 some 18 months ago, FreeBSD has "
"changed almost entirely. A new port from the Berkeley 4.4 code base was "
"done, which brought the legal status of the system out of the shadows with "
"the blessing of Novell (new owners of USL and UNIX). The port to 4.4 also "
"brought in a host of new features, filesystems and enhanced driver support. "
"With our new unencumbered code base, we have every reason to hope that we'll "
"be able to release quality operating systems without further legal "
"encumbrance for some time to come!"
