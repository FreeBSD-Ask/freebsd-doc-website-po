"32-bit ARMv6 and ARMv7 is officially a link:{committers-guide}#archs[Tier 2] "

"releases or pre-built packages for this platform due to it primarily "
"targeting the embedded arena. However, FreeBSD/ARM is being actively "
"developed and maintained, is well supported, and provides an excellent "
"framework for building ARM-based systems. FreeBSD/arm supported ARMv4 and "
"ARMv5 processors, and is deprecated as of 13.0. FreeBSD/armv7 includes SMP "
