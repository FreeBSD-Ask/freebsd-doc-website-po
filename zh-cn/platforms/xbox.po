"In order to boot FreeBSD you must have an up-to-date version of the "
"Linux/xbox BIOS, called Cromwell (failure will result in your kernel "
"crashing immediately after loading). A Cromwell with FreeBSD UFS patches "
"(this will make it able to load a kernel directly from an UFS file system) "
"is available in the ports tree at /usr/ports/sysutils/cromwell; it can be "
"flashed to the EEPROM using the /usr/ports/sysutils/raincoat port (as long "
"as your Xbox is below version 1.6)."
