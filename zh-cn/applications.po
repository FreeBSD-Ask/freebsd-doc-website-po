"There is no doubt that so-called open systems are _the_ requirement for "

"*Internet services.* Many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) find FreeBSD "
"ideal, running WWW, Usenet news, FTP, Email, and other "
"services. Ready-to-run software like the http://nginx.org[NGINX] or "
"http://www.apache.org/[Apache] web server or the "
"http://proftpd.org/[ProFTPD] or "
"http://security.appspot.com/vsftpd.html[vsftpd] FTP server make it easy to "
"set up a business or community-centered ISP. Of course, with FreeBSD's "
"unbeatable link:../internet/[networking], your users will enjoy high speed, "
"reliable services.\n"

"*X Window workstation.* From an inexpensive X terminal to an advanced X "
"display, FreeBSD works quite well. Free X software (http://x.org/[X.Org](T)) "
"comes with the system. http://www.nvidia.com/[NVIDIA] offers native drivers "
"for their high-performance graphics hardware, and the industry standard "
"http://www.opengroup.org/motif/[Motif](R) and "
"http://www.opengl.org/[OpenGL](R) libraries are supported. The "
"http://xfce.org/[Xfce] and http://lxde.org/[LXDE] products provide a desktop "
"environment. The http://www.kde.org[KDE] and http://www.gnome.org[GNOME] "
"desktop environments also enjoy full support and provide office suite "
"functionality, with further good functionality available in the "
"https://www.libreoffice.org/[LibreOffice], "

"*Software development.* A suite of development tools comes with FreeBSD, "

"also provided and will eventually replace the GNU suite. Java(R) and Tcl/Tk "
"development are also possible for example, and more esoteric programming "
"languages like Icon work just fine, too. And FreeBSD's shared libraries have "
"always been easy to make and use. You can also choose from a wide range of "
"popular and powerful editors, such as Emacs and Vim.\n"
