"However, if you already have the Ports Collection installed on your machine, "
"you may also search by changing to the `/usr/ports` directory and performing "
"`make search name=`__string__. Instead of by `name` you can search by port "
"path (`path`), port information (`info`), maintainer (`maint`), port "
"category (`cat`), build dependencies (`bdeps`), run dependencies (`rdeps`), "
"the project web site (`www`), or any of these fields (`key`). Use `make "
"quicksearch ...` to only display the port name, port directory, and one line "
"description of the port."
