"The Ports Collection supports the latest release on the "
"link:{faq}#current[FreeBSD-CURRENT] and link:{faq}#stable[FreeBSD-STABLE] "
"branches. Older releases are not supported and may or may not work correctly "
"with an up-to-date ports collection. Over time, changes to the ports "
"collection may rely on features that are not present in older "
"releases. Wherever convenient, we try not to gratuitously break support for "
"recent releases, but it is sometimes unavoidable. When this occurs, patches "
"contributed by the user community to maintain support for older releases "
"will usually be committed."

"Each \"port\" listed here contains any patches necessary to make the "
"original application source code compile and run on FreeBSD. Installing an "
"application is as simple as typing `make install` in the port directory. If "
"you download the framework for the entire list of ports by installing the "
"link:{handbook}ports/#ports-using[ports hierarchy], you can have thousands "
"of applications right at your fingertips."

"Each port's `Makefile` automatically fetches the application source code, "
"either from a local disk, CD-ROM or via "
"link:https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ftp[`ftp`], unpacks it on "
"your system, applies the patches, and compiles. If all went well, a simple "
"`make install` will install the application and register it with the package "
"system."

"securely download and install the precompiled version of a port. For more "
