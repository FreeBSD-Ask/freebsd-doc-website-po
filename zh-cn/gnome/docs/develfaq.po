"*DEVELOPMENT* - In between stable releases are development "
"releases. Traditionally, GNOME development releases have odd minor numbers "
"(e.g. 2.3, {gnomedevelver}, 3.(n*2)-1). Development releases will become "
"stable releases, and move from alpha to beta quality during their "
"lifecycle. The development releases need testing by FreeBSD users to "
"minimize the number of surprises when the new stable versions are committed "
"to the FreeBSD SVN tree. This document is about the development branch. At "
"any time the development branch for FreeBSD might be based of a stable GNOME "
"release. However it will be tagged \"development\" here if it is the version "
"that is work in progress by the FreeBSD GNOME team. The current development "
"branch for FreeBSD is GNOME {gnomedevelver}.\n"

"The short answer is that you need to use the `marcusmerge` script to merge "

"is available http://www.marcuscom.com/downloads/marcusmerge[here], and a man "
"page on using the script is available "
"http://www.marcuscom.com/marcusmerge.8.html[here]. This script will merge "
"the development ports tree into your main ports tree. From there, you can "
"use `portupgrade` or `portmaster` to upgrade from {gnomever} to "
"{gnomedevelver} and stay up-to-date afterwards."

"The long answer is that keeping up-to-date with the GNOME development branch "
"is complicated. Sometimes components change in a way that makes "
"`portupgrade` or `portmaster` fail, or causes strange end results. If you "

"https://lists.FreeBSD.org/subscription/freebsd-gnome[freebsd-gnome] mailing "
