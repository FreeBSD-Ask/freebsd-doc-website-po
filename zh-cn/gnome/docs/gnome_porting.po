"|*COMPONENT* |*ASSOCIATED PROGRAM* |*IMPLIED COMPONENTS*\n"
"|esound |audio/esound |\n"
"|gnomehack |gnomehack makes common GNOME Makefile substitutions that nearly "
"every GNOME port requires to fit into the proper mtree structure. |\n"
"|gnomehier |gnomehier installs all the directories needed for both the GNOME "
"1 and 2 desktops. Only include this option if your port calls @dirrm on one "
"of the directories listed in the plist for gnomehier. |\n"
"|gnomemimedata |misc/gnome-mime-data |gnomehier pkgconfig\n"
"|gnomeprefix |gnomeprefix sets some CONFIGURE_ARGS to ensure data is placed "
"properly within the GNOME hierarchy. |gnomehier\n"
"|intlhack |intlhack registers a dependency upon textproc/intltool and "
"patches broken intltool-merge.in implementations. |intltool\n"
"|intltool |intltool registers a BUILD_DEPENDS on textproc/intltool. |\n"
"|lthack |lthack prevents the installation of .la files and ensures that "
"$\\{PTHREAD_LIBS} will be passed to the linker. NOTE: lthack is DEPRECATED, "
"and USE_AUTOTOOLS=\"libtool\":15 should be used instead. See the libtool "
"section of the porting guide for more details. |\n"
"|ltasneededhack |ltasneededhack hacks the port's "
"link:../porting/#libtool[libtool] so that the -Wl,--as-needed flag is passed "
"to the linker. This will result in shared objects with smaller ELF NEEDED "
"sections which can improve the startup time and module load time of some "
"applications. In order to use ltasneededhack the port must define "
"USE_AUTOTOOLS=\"libtool\":15. NOTE: be sure to thoroughly test the resulting "
"application to make sure there are no undefined symbol errors after adding "
"this hack. |\n"
"|ltverhack |ltverhack normalizes shared object versions so that they do not "
"change needlessly. Using ltverhack keeps shared object versions in line with "
"what they should be and what they end up being on other operating "
"systems. In order to use ltverhack the port must define "
"USE_AUTOTOOLS=\"libtool\":15. |\n"
"|pkgconfig |pkgconfig registers a dependency upon devel/pkg-config to make "
"sure it is installed. |\n"
"|referencehack |referencehack is designed for ports that install API "
"reference documentation. These ports should use referencehack then another "
"port with a -reference suffix should be created to install this "
"documentation. See devel/glib20 and devel/glib20-reference for an "
"example. |\n"
