"*The FreeBSD Foundation received a donation of a blade system from "
"Hewlett-Packard for use as a third-party software build cluster. This "
"20-node HP BladeSystem cluster triples the speed of the build process for "
"i386 packages.*\n"

"_\"With this generous donation from HP, we are able to continuously produce "
"up-to-date packages from more than 13000 ports of third-party software "
"available in the FreeBSD Ports Collection, at about three times the rate of "
"the previous hardware cluster,\"_ said Kris Kennaway, member of the FreeBSD "
"Ports Management Team."

"Kennaway said FreeBSD has a few dozen other machines scattered around the "
"globe for package builds. A big concentration of sparc machines hosted by "
"Hiroki Sato in Japan include some large multiprocessor e4500's (10, 12 and "
"14 CPUs) that have been extremely valuable for SMP testing. Also, a couple "
"of machines hosted by ISC, an amd64 hosted by Scott Long, three i386 "
"machines at Yahoo! Korea, and sometimes Kennaway's own machines in Canada "
"are used for the official package builds."
