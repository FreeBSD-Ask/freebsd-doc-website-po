"FreeBSD Project co-founder and continuing Core Team member Jordan Hubbard "
"expressed excitement over the results, \"For the first time since the "
"FreeBSD project was formed, open elections have determined the composition "
"of its core team and set an important precedent whereby any developer can "
"now become part of the project's leadership.\" The new core team also "
"well-represents FreeBSD's diverse and highly skilled group of international "
"developers, with expertise ranging from RAID filesystem and device-driver "
"development to extensive security backgrounds."

"New Core Team members were elected from and by the FreeBSD committers team, "
"the formal development staff of the FreeBSD project. Committers have direct "
"access to the FreeBSD source repository, and perform the majority of "
"software development associated with the project. Until this point, the Core "
"Team was a self-selected board providing architectural and administrative "
"direction."

"FreeBSD is a liberally-licensed open source operating system with its "
"origins in BSD Net/2 and 4.4 Lite, the Berkeley Software Distributions "
"developed at the University of California at Berkeley until 1994. It is "
"developed and maintained by a global organization of paid and volunteer "
"contributors. FreeBSD is distinguished by its high performance networking "
"and filesystem support, and is widely used among Internet service providers, "
"including industry-recognized companies such as *Yahoo!*, *above.net*, and "
"*Verio*. FreeBSD is also frequently used as a platform for embedded "
"networking devices, including products from *IBM*, *Inktomi*, *Juniper "
"Networks*, and *Network Alchemy - a Nokia Company*."
