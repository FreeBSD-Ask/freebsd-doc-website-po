"Berkeley Software Distribution operating system technologies were originally "
"developed from 1979 to 1992 by the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at "
"the University of California at Berkeley. Berkeley-derived operating system "
"and networking technologies are at the heart of most modern Unix and "
"Unix-like operating systems. Today, virtually every major Internet "
"infrastructure provider uses BSD operating systems. BSD operating system "
"technologies are used by leading mission- critical network computing "
"environments and are embedded in Internet appliance platforms that require "
"advanced Internet functionality, reliability and security."
