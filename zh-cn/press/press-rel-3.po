"NetBSD and FreeBSD are open source operating systems based on the last "
"public release of BSD UNIX, 4.4BSDLite2. Each effort has kept up with the "
"latest technologies in processors and software architectures. While having "
"different priorities, the BSD development teams share a friendly competitive "
"rivalry, spurring each other on to produce better product for their "
"worldwide users. Over the twenty years of development, a huge base of "
"software has been developed around BSD -- including much of the Internet "
"infrastructure -- enabling the OS to be used effectively in almost any "
"computing application. The open development model means there are no "
"secrets, creating a worldwide understanding of the code which enables BSD "
"developers to build on the efforts of prior developers without the hassles "
"endemic to proprietary operating systems and applications."
