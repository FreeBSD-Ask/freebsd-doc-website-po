"Manex Visual Effects used 32 Dell Precision 410 Dual P-II/450 Processor "
"systems running FreeBSD as the core CG Render Farm. Charles Henrich, the "
"senior systems administrator at Manex, says, \"We came to a point in the "
"production where we realized we just did not have enough computing power on "
"our existing SGI infrastructure to get through the 3-D intensive "
"sequences. It was at that point we decided on going with a FreeBSD based "
"solution, due to the ability to get the hardware quickly as well as the "
"reliability and ease of administration that FreeBSD provides us. Working "
"with Dell, we purchased 32 of these systems on a Wednesday, and had them "
"rendering in production by Saturday afternoon. It was truly an amazing "
"effort on everyone's part, and I don't believe it would've been possible had "
"we chosen to go with any other Operating System solution.\""

"The FreeBSD operating system is a powerful, completely open-source system "
"based on the Berkeley Software Distribution of UNIX. It is available free of "
"charge from numerous Internet websites and also on CD-ROM from Walnut Creek "
"CDROM, and includes thousands of ported applications including 3-D graphics "
"rendering and many other equally powerful tools. FreeBSD is optimized for "
"use on the Intel x86 processor line that is the heart of today's versatile "
"commodity personal computers. Infinitely customizable, FreeBSD is at the "
"heart of such Internet powerhouse applications as Yahoo! and U.S. West "
"because it is unencumbered by commercial license restrictions and can be "
"copied and modified freely."
