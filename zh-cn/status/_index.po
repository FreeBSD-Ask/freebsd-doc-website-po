"One of the benefits of the FreeBSD development model is a focus on "
"centralized design and implementation, in which the operating system is "
"maintained in a central repository, and discussed on centrally maintained "
"lists. This allows for a high level of coordination between authors of "
"various components of the system, and allows policies to be enforced over "
"the entire system, covering issues ranging from architecture to "
"style. However, as the FreeBSD developer community has grown, and the rate "
"of both mailing list traffic and tree modifications has increased, making it "
"difficult even for the most dedicated developer to remain on top of all the "
"work going on in the tree."

"The FreeBSD Development Status Report attempts to address this problem by "
"providing a vehicle that allows developers to make the broader community "
"aware of their on-going work on FreeBSD, both in and out of the central "
"source repository. For each project and sub-project, a one paragraph summary "
"is included, indicating progress since the last summary. If it is a new "
"project, or if a project has not submitted any prior status reports, a short "
"description may precede the status information."
