"FreeBSD status reports are published quarterly and provide the general "
"public with a view of what is going on in the Project, and they are often "
"augmented by special reports from Developer Summits. As they are one of our "
"most visible forms of communication, they are very important. This page will "
"provide some advice on writing status report entries from "
"mailto:theraven@FreeBSD.org[David Chisnall], experienced in technical "
"writing."
