"to lower its costs. The OSKit makes it vastly easier to create a new OS, "
"port an existing OS to the x86 (or in the future, to other architectures "
"supported by the OSkit), or enhance an OS to support a wider range of "
"devices, filesystem formats, executable formats, or network services. The "
"OSKit also works well for constructing OS-related programs, such as boot "
