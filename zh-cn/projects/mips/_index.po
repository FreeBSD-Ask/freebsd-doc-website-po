"The FreeBSD/MIPS Project is responsible for the maintenance and development "
"of FreeBSD on platforms using MIPS processors. The port currently runs "
"multi-user on a number of platforms and a wide variety of 32-bit and 64-bit "
"MISP ISA processors."

"FreeBSD supports a broad range of MIPS-based devices, including MIPS Malta, "
"Ubiquiti Networks Router-Station and Router-Station Pro, Cavium Octeon, "
"NetLogicMicro/RMI XLS and XLR (XLP in progress), as well as emulated MIPS "
"environments such as gxemul. On supporting hardware platforms, FreeBSD "
"supports both multi-core and hardware multi-threading features. In many "
"cases, additional accelerator functions, such as cryptographic and network "
"offload engines, are also supported."
