"Google Summer of Code is an exciting opportunity for contributors to "
"\"intern\" with an open source project for a summer. The FreeBSD Project, as "
"one of the most successful and oldest open source projects, is an excellent "
"place to do this internship. Founded in 1993, the project now consists of "
"several hundred \"committers\" and tens of thousands of "
"contributors. FreeBSD is the foundation for many commercial products, "
"including Apple's Mac OS X, NetApp's OnTap/GX, Juniper's JunOS, as well "
"countless other products, and is widely used in the Internet Service "
"Provider and corporate IT worlds. Many of these sponsors participate daily "
"in the FreeBSD community, and contributors have the opportunity to develop "
"software ideas in an exciting environment with many real world applications, "
"and under the mentorship of experienced developers."

"The FreeBSD Project maintains a "
