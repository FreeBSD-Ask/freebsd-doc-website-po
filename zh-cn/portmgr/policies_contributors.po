"We have an add-on to the Problem Reports database known as the "

"however, it depends on the Summary containing category/portname. In general, "
"various people attempt to catch and fix cases where it does not work, but "
"you should not assume so. Therefore, please check to see whether or not the "
"maintainer knows about the PR before declaring a timeout. You can generally "
"tell this from the Audit-Trail and Cc: lines in the PR."
