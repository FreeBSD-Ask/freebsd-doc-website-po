"Unlike the `src` tree, the FreeBSD ports tree is *not* branched. It has "

"There are thousands, if not tens of thousands, of user installations that "
"track the ports tree on a daily basis, rather than relying on the packages "
"that shipped with the most current FreeBSD release. Accordingly, any fatal "
"error in the ports framework will immediately affect all of these "
"sites. This is why commits to `bsd.port.mk` are only allowed with portmgr "
"approval. Except in unusual cases, this approval is only granted after a "
"regression test has been run on a dedicated area of the automated "
"http://pointyhat.FreeBSD.org[ports building cluster]. Typically, a dozen or "
"more proposed changes to the infrastructure are tested at the same time, and "
"only after a build of the entire ports tree succeeds will portmgr commit the "
"changes."

msgid ""
"When a new release of FreeBSD is upcoming, committers are asked to shift "
"their emphasis away from introducing new ports and features and instead "
"focus on fixing existing problems. At some time during the release, the tree "
"is `tagged` and packages are created from each of the ports, for each of the "
"architectures. Due to the large number of ports and the speed of the slower "
"architectures, the build process takes several days."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

msgid ""
"In an ideal world, these would be the packages that went on the release CDs, "
"and the time from the creation of the packages to the time of the actual "
"release would be just long enough to test them and no longer. However, in "
"practice, problems are found with both the ports and with the source tree as "
"the QA effort continues. But to be able to release in a timely manner, only "
"certain port changes will be merged back into the actual (tagged) tree, and "
"the affected packages will be rebuilt. Only severe security problems and "
"licensing issues will have their tags slipped in this manner."

"Since the release period can take weeks, it is unrealistic not to allow any "
"commit to the ports tree during this time. The problem with allowing "
"unrestricted commits at that time is that it becomes impossible to separate "
"out only the critical changes so that they, and only they, can have their "
"affected tags slipped. The terminology for changes that are not allowed is "
"`sweeping changes`."

"A `sweeping change` is a commit that would affect a non-trivial number of "
"packages in a way such that any other change (such as fixing a single "
"security problem) would mean that we would have to rebuild the entire set of "
"packages, which would delay the upcoming release, possibly by weeks, because "
"the set of changes overlap."
