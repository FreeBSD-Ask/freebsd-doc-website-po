"FreeBSD's distinguished roots derive from the *BSD* software releases from "
"the Computer Systems Research Group at the University of California, "
"Berkeley. Over twenty years of work have been put into enhancing FreeBSD, "
"adding industry-leading scalability, network performance, management tools, "
"file systems, and security features. As a result, FreeBSD may be found "
"across the Internet, in the operating system of core router products, "
"running root name servers, hosting major web sites, and as the foundation "
"for widely used desktop operating systems. This is only possible because of "
"the diverse and worldwide membership of the volunteer FreeBSD Project."

"*Hhook*: (Helper Hook) and khelp(9) (Kernel Helpers) KPIs have been "

"export hook points that khelp(9) modules can hook to provide enhanced or new "
"functionality to the kernel. The khelp(9) KPI provides a framework for "
"managing khelp(9) modules, which indirectly use the hhook(9) KPI to register "
"their hook functions with hook points of interest within the "
"kernel. Together, they allow a structured way to dynamically extend the "
"kernel at runtime in an ABI-preserving manner.\n"
