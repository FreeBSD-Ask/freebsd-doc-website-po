"As part of an ongoing effort to improve the overall release process _before_ "
"a release actually slips out the door with problems, we are now periodically "
"producing interim test releases called _snapshots_. These snapshots will be "
"very similar to full releases, except that they might not include all the "
"bits included in a full release (such as packages and updated "
"documentation)."

"`<target>` and `<target_arch>` represent the architecture for which the "

"The snapshots are primarily for testing purposes and not fully tested "

"The major release number will not be changed in the main distribution for "
"each snapshot. It will _only_ be changed on the installation medium so that "
"you know when the snapshot was made. These are _not_ releases, these are "
"_snapshots_, and it is important that this distinction be "
"preserved. Although people can and will, of course, refer to snapshots by "
"date in email, do not confuse them."

"Finally, we will not necessarily update the documentation. For example, "
"`README` may still refer to a previous release. This is because that is much "
"less important than getting the real bug fixes and new features out for "
"testing. Please do not send a bug report about version numbers."

"Your feedback on these snapshots is greatly welcome. They are not just for "
"our benefit - those who are coming to rely on FreeBSD for mission critical "
"applications should welcome a chance to get at more updated bits in a "
"structured fashion. You can also use these snapshots as tangible evidence "
"that your feedback is getting incorporated and that you (hopefully) will not "
"have any unpleasant surprises in the next release. On the other hand, if you "
"do send us hate mail next release and it turns out that you never even tried "
"the snapshots, well, it cuts both ways!"
