"The FreeBSD Project aims to produce a complete, BSD-licensed operating "
"system allowing consumers of the system to produce derivative products "
"without constraint or further license obligations. We invite and greatly "
"appreciate the contribution of both changes and additions under the "
"two-clause BSD license, and encourage the adoption of this license by other "
"open source projects. Use of the BSD license is key to encouraging the "
"adoption of advanced operating system technology, and on many notable "
"occasions has been pivotal to widespread use of new technology."

"Unless a special exception is made, no existing BSD-licensed components may "
"be replaced with differently-licensed software. We instead encourage FreeBSD "
"and third party developers to seek the relicensing or reimplementation of "
"critical components under the BSD license. Such would ease their more "
"integral adoption into the FreeBSD operating system."

"Historically, the phrase 'All Rights Reserved.' was included in all "
"copyright notices. The BSD releases had it to comply with the Buenos Aires "
"Convention of 1910 in the Americas. With the ratification of the Berne "
"Convention in 2000, it became obsolete. As such, the FreeBSD project "
"recommends that new code omit the phrase and encourages existing copyright "
"holders to remove it. In 2018, the project updated its templates to remove "
"it."
