"Over time, FreeBSD committers may find other demands on their time, and "
"decide that they wish to resign their commit bit.  However, under some "
"circumstances, a committer may become inactive over a long period of time "
"without explicitly resigning their bit.  Over the long term, these accounts "
"can represent a security risk, as well as posing procedural questions "
"regarding the degree to which contact information and access methods for the "
"account are maintainable.  For these reasons, the FreeBSD Core Team approved "
"the following commit bit expiration policy, last updated in February 2021."

"Documentation and source committers that have not made a commit in 18 months "
"may have their commit bit removed from the access file.  For ports "
"committers this period is 12 months.  Committers are encouraged to "
"reactivate their commit bit by contacting the appropriate authority."

"If all of a committer's commit bits expire, then the committer's "
"`FreeBSD.org` account will be suspended.  It can remain active upon request "
"at the FreeBSD Core Team's discretion.  An account is suspended by disabling "
"login access and any other services (such as CGI scripts or non-trivial mail "
"forwarding configurations) that execute under the committer's account.  "
"Simple mail forwarding will continue to work, and an individual may e-mail "
"`postmaster@FreeBSD.org` to update mail forwarding settings.  The "
"committer's files may or may not be preserved at the FreeBSD Core Team's "
"discretion.  A suspended account will be reactivated if any of a committer's "
"commit bits are restored."
