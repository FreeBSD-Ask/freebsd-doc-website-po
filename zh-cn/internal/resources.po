"The core team manages access to project resources including granting and "
"revoking both commit bits and user accounts. Core may delegate portions of "
"these tasks to other groups or individuals at its discretion. For example, "
"certain commit bits are managed by other groups as noted in "
"link:{committers-guide}#committer.types[Commit Bit Types] subject to core's "
"final approval. The core team has held this authority since its inception, "
"but wanted to make it explicit to avoid confusion. The FreeBSD Core team "
"approved the following commit bit and project resources policy which was "
"posted to the Developers mailing list on August 4, 2011."
