"The little red fellow that graces many of these pages is the BSD Daemon. In "
"the context of UNIX(R) systems, daemons are process that run in the "
"background attending to various tasks without human intervention. In the "
"general sense, daemon is an older form of the word demon. In the _Unix "
"System Administration Handbook_, Evi Nemeth has this to say about daemons:"

"\"Many people equate the word \"daemon\" with the word \"demon,\" implying "
"some kind of Satanic connection between UNIX(R) and the underworld. This is "
"an egregious misunderstanding. \"Daemon\" is actually a much older form of "
"\"demon\"; daemons have no particular bias towards good or evil, but rather "
"serve to help define a person's character or personality. The ancient "
"Greeks' concept of a \"personal daemon\" was similar to the modern concept "
"of a \"guardian angel\" - \"eudaemonia\" is the state of being helped or "
"protected by a kindly spirit. As a rule, UNIX(R) systems seem to be infested "
"with both daemons and demons.\" (p403)"

"The earliest (and most popular) renditions of the BSD Daemon were created by "

"http://FromTo.Cc/hosokawa/gallery/[Tatsumi Hosokawa], but the basic "
"inspiration was definitely John's. The copyright holder and creator of the "
"daemon image is mailto:mckusick@mckusick.com[Marshall Kirk McKusick]. A "
"short http://www.mckusick.com/beastie/index.html[pictorial history] is also "
"available. There is a gallery of FreeBSD related "
