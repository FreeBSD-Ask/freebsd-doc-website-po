"In 2005 several countries, including the United States of America and "
"Canada, passed legislation changing when Daylight Savings Time begins and "
"ends. That change takes effect in 2007. For the time zones affected by the "
"change Daylight Savings Time will begin on March 11th (instead of April 1st) "
"and end on November 4th (instead of October 28th)."

"FreeBSD uses `/etc/localtime` to control the conversion of the system's "
"internal representation of time (based on UTC) to the format appropriate for "
"the local time zone. That file gets copied from one of the files in "
"`/usr/share/zoneinfo` by the tzsetup(8) command, usually as part of the "
"initial installation procedure. The change in Daylight Savings Time rules "
"affects the files in `/usr/share/zoneinfo` for the time zones affected by "
"the legislation passed in 2005."

"February 2007, FreeBSD-6.2 and FreeBSD-5.5 have up to date zoneinfo "
"files. FreeBSD-6.1 has correct zoneinfo files for time zones in the United "
"States of America but out of date zoneinfo files for some of the other "
"countries affected (for example Canada). An Errata Notice will be released "
"shortly to update the zoneinfo files in FreeBSD-6.1."
