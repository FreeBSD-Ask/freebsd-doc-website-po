"IPv6 has a mandatory link-local address. In times where many people are also "

"services they started would be accessible by other people on the same "

"place. To not put people at risk, IPv6 is disabled by default on FreeBSD. + "
"However we already provide support for you to configure it from our "
"installer and it will automatically start to work as soon as you configure "
"an interface for stateless address auto-configuration (SLAAC) or with a "
