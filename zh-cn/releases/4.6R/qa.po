"  <li>sppp(4) upgrade.  The ISDN project (i4b) once maintained an\n"
"    off-spring version of the SyncPPP driver, with a number of\n"
"    enhancements and bug-fixes made to it by people contributing to\n"
"    the i4b project.  On the other hand, other improvements and\n"
"    bug-fixes of the regular tree's sppp driver didn't make it back\n"
"    to that version, so eventually two different SyncPPP drivers\n"
"    developed.  The i4b version has been merged back in FreeBSD-current\n"
"    a few months ago, and these changes have now been folded into\n"
"    FreeBSD-stable as well, thus eliminating i4b's separate version.\n"
"    sppp users (of both flavours) should carefully test the new\n"
"    version.  Users who previously used the i4b version should find\n"
"    all those improvements still being present (most notably, VJ header\n"
"    compression).  Users who use sppp on hardware (HDLC) devices (like\n"
"    ar(4) or sr(4)) should see no breakage, but might notice that the\n"
"    negotiation of VJ header compression is now enabled by default.\n"
"    Use spppcontrol(8) to modify the default behaviour.  Please report\n"
"    any breakage or oddity you observe to &lt;joerg@FreeBSD.org&gt;.</li>\n"
