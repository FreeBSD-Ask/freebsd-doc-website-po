"Just in under the wire for the current millenium, I'm happy to announce the "
"availability of FreeBSD 3.4-RELEASE, the very latest in 3.x-STABLE branch "
"technology. Following the release of FreeBSD 3.3 in Sept, 1999, a lot of new "
"features have been added, many bugs were fixed and even more important "
"security issues were dealt with. Please see the link:notes.html[release "
"notes] for more information."

"FreeBSD 3.4-RELEASE is available at "
"ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/[ftp.FreeBSD.org] and various "
"https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/mirrors.html[FTP mirror sites] throughout "
"the world. It can also be ordered on CD from http://www.FreeBSDMall.com/[The "
"FreeBSD Mall], from where it will be shipping soon on a 4 CD set containing "
"installation bits for x86 architecture, as well as a lot of other material "
"of general interest to programmers and end-users alike (3.4-RELEASE for the "
"Alpha architecture is available from the FTP site and will also be available "
"on CDROM several weeks after the x86 product is released)."

"All of the profits from the sales of this CD set go to support the FreeBSD "
"Project! We are also continuing our new tradition (started with 3.3-RELEASE) "
"of making disc #1 from Walnut Creek CDROM's official distribution available "
"via anonymous FTP. This is the most important CD of their 4 set, one which "
"will allow users to install the base system and all of its most important "
"add-ons from a single ISO 9660 image. We are doing this because the ISO "
"image is rapidly becoming the preferred format for distributing operating "
"system releases and we're certainly not going to go out of our way to make "
"FreeBSD harder to \"test drive\" if providing the standard NFS/FTP network "
"installation methods is no longer enough. This is a fully-bootable ISO 9660 "
"(with RockRidge extensions) image and can be written as a raw ISO image by "
"most CD creator software."
