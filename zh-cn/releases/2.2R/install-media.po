"2.2-RELEASE will not support installation of machines with 4MB of memory or "
"1.2MB floppy drives - that is to say, only > 5MB memory & 1.44MB floppy "
"drive systems are supported. In truth, 8MB of memory is the recommended "
"minimum."

"Those who have such limitations on their configuration and can't upgrade, "
"for whatever reason, are therefore urged to stay with 2.1.6-RELEASE, which "
"has provisions for both types of installation and will probably be more than "
"functional for as long as one might conceivably wish to continue operating "
"such a system."

"We regret any inconvenience this may cause some of our users, but we have "
"also been pressed for space on the installation media for some time now, and "
"this was more or less inevitable. We've talked about killing the 4MB "
"installation and 1.2MB floppies for over a year, and it's only through some "
"of the most arcane trickery (you don't want to know) that we've managed to "
"keep it all on a single floppy at all. Now that we've made the leap to "
"1.44MB/>6MB class machines, we've at least bought ourselves some room for "
"future enhancements while still remaining on one floppy."

"Note that you can still build kernels which will run quite comfortably in a "
"4MB system, you just can't *install* with only 4MB in the machine. If you're "
"trying to build a custom box with 4MB and a tiny configuration, for example, "
"you might simply build its disk on a different machine set up specifically "
"for that purpose."
