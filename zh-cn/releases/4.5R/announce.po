"have made hundreds of fixes, updated many system components, made\n"
"several substantial performance improvements, and addressed a wide\n"

"  contains improvements to the TCP stack to provide better throughput.\n"
"  In addition, TCP performance is aided by larger default buffer\n"
"  sizes.  Finally, FreeBSD 4.5 contains new mechanisms to mitigate the\n"
