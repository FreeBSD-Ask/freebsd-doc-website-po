"the program you wish to install, type make and let the system do the\n"
"rest.  The full original distribution for each port you build is\n"
"retrieved dynamically off of CDROM or a local ftp site, so you need\n"
"only enough disk space to build the ports you want.  (Almost) every\n"
"port is also provided as a pre-compiled \"package\" which can be\n"
