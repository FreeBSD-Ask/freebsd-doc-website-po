"Well, it's a bit late and hopefully all the better for it, but here it "
"is. It gives me great pleasure to announce the release of FreeBSD "
"4.0-RELEASE. This is our first release along the 4.x-stable (RELENG_4) "
"branch and contains a number of significant advancements over FreeBSD "
"3.4. Please see the release notes for further information as the list of new "
"features is too long to list here."

"FreeBSD 4.0-RELEASE is available from ftp.FreeBSD.org and various FTP mirror "
"sites throughout the world. It can also be ordered on CD from "
"http://www.freebsdmall.com/[The FreeBSD Mall], from where it will be "
"shipping soon on a 4 CD set. There will also be two such sets available for "
"4.0, one containing installation bits for the x86 architecture (as well a "
"lot of other material of general interest to programmers and end-users "
"alike) and another for DEC Alpha architecture machines."
