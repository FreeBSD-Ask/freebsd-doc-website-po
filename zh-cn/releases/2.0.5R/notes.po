"Since our release of FreeBSD 2.0 some 8 months ago, the performance,\n"
"feature set, and stability of FreeBSD has improved dramatically.  The\n"
"largest change is a revamped VM system with a merged VM/file buffer\n"
"cache that not only increases performance, but reduces FreeBSD's\n"
"memory footprint, making a 4MB configuration a more acceptable\n"
"minimum.  Other enhancements include full NIS client and server\n"
"support, transaction TCP support, dial-on-demand PPP, an improved SCSI\n"
"subsystem, early ISDN support, support for FDDI and Fast Ethernet\n"
"(100Mbit) adapters, improved support for the Adaptec 2940 (WIDE and\n"
"narrow) and many hundreds of bug fixes.\n"

"In addition to the base distributions, FreeBSD offers a new ported\n"
"software collection with some 270 commonly sought-after programs.  The\n"
"list of ports ranges from http (WWW) servers, to games, languages,\n"
"editors and almost everything in between.  The entire ports collection\n"
"requires only 10MB of storage, all ports being expressed as \"deltas\"\n"
"to their original sources.  This makes it much easier for us to update\n"
"ports, and greatly reduces the disk space demands made by the older\n"
"1.0 ports collection.  To compile a port, you simply change to the\n"
"directory of the program you wish to install, type make and let the\n"
"system do the rest.  The full original distribution for each port you\n"
"build is retrieved dynamically off of CDROM or a local ftp site, so\n"
"you need only enough disk space to build the ports you want.  (Almost)\n"
"every port is also provided as a pre-compiled \"package\" which can be\n"
"installed with a simple command (pkg_add) by those who do not wish to\n"
"compile their own ports from source.  See the file:\n"
"        /usr/share/FAQ/Text/ports.FAQ\n"

"port to 4.4 has also brought in a host of new features, filesystems\n"
"and enhanced driver support.  With our new unencumbered code base, we\n"
