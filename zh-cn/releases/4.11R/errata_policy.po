"\t<p>The classification of things that are Errata candidates are things\n"
"\t  that are severe service-disrupting bugs for which there is no known\n"
"\t  work-around.  Things like bugs in device drivers that impair their\n"
"\t  expected functionality, things that can cause kernel panics, etc.</p>\n"

"      <h2>Initial Patch</h2>\n"
"\t<p>During the initial phases the fix for Errata should be\n"
"\t  handled exactly like any other fix.  It should initially\n"
"\t  be committed to HEAD if possible and go through the normal\n"
"\t  testing period there.  The fix should then be MFCed as usual.\n"
"\t  Since HEAD and RELENG_5 have become dramatically different\n"
"\t  from RELENG_4 in many areas this may not be possible, and\n"
"\t  the initial commit may need to be applied straight to\n"
"\t  RELENG_4.  At this point if you feel a fix is an Errata\n"
"\t  Notice candidate please contact the Release Engineering Team\n"
"\t  to make them aware of it.</p>\n"

"\t<p>The fix should then sit in RELENG_4 for one to two weeks.  During\n"
"\t  this period please try to have the fix reviewed by another senior\n"
"\t  Developer familiar with the section of the code you are working with.\n"
"\t  You should also get confirmation that the fix solves the problem from\n"
"\t  someone who had reported the problem.  Assuming no problems come up\n"
"\t  during this testing period then send in the formal request to\n"
"\t  <a href=\"mailto:re@FreeBSD.org\" shape=\"rect\">re@FreeBSD.org</a>.  "
"Please include\n"
"\t  the patch that will need to be applied to 4.11 and who has\n"
"\t  reviewed the fix.</p>\n"
