"Yes, it's that time again! I'm very happy to announce the availability of "
"FreeBSD 3.3-RELEASE, the latest in our line of releases from the 3.x-STABLE "
"branch. The follow-on to FreeBSD 3.2 (released in May, 1999), a lot of new "
"drivers have been added, many bugs were fixed and several important security "
"issues where dealt with. Please see the link:../notes/[release notes] for "

"https://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/mirrors.html[FTP mirror sites] throughout "
"the world. It can also be ordered on CD from http://www.freebsdmall.com/[The "
"FreeBSD Mall], from where it will be shipping soon on a 4 CD set containing "
"installation bits for the x86 architectures, as well a lot of other material "
"of general interest to programmers and end-users alike. (3.3-RELEASE for the "
"Alpha architecture is available from the FTP site)."

"important CD of their 4 set, one which will allow users to install the base "
"system and all of its most important add-ons from a single ISO 9660 "
"image. We are doing this because the ISO image is rapidly becoming the "
"preferred format for distributing operating system releases and we're "
"certainly not going to go out of our way to make FreeBSD harder to \"test "
"drive\" if providing the standard NFS/FTP network installation methods is no "
"longer enough. We can't promise that all the mirror sites will carry the "
"rather large installation (660MB) image, but it will at least be available "
