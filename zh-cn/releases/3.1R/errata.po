"Fix: The problem here is that though the compatibility a.out libraries\n"
"     may have been installed from compat22 and as part of the XFree86\n"
"     distribution, the a.out library (ldconfig) cache has not yet been\n"
"     built given that this doesn't happen until the system has booted\n"
"     completely at least once.  This causes packages which require the\n"
"     old a.out libraries (like netscape) to get confused if they're\n"
"     installed before that has occurred.  To work around the problem,\n"
"     simply complete the installation as normal and come up fully,\n"
"     then re-run /stand/sysinstall (or use the pkg_add(1) command\n"
"     directly) to re-install the failing package(s).\n"
