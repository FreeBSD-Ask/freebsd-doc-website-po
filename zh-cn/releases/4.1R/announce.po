"ISO images of the installation CD will be made available by August 1st 2000, "
"after the bits have undergone a bit more integration testing. This "
"additional delay is necessary given that the ISO images are so large (~650MB "
"each) and are not something which many people want to transfer more than "
"once. A follow-up announcement will be sent once the ISO images are in "
"place, so please don't send me email asking where they are or when they'll "
"be ready. When they're ready, they'll be uploaded and an announcement will "
