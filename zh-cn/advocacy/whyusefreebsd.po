"FreeBSD is a community-driven operating system despite it being to a partial "

"There is no dictator—benevolent or otherwise—for the project. The Core Team "

"Stability means many different things. FreeBSD very rarely crashes (and when "

"Stability in FreeBSD means much more than that. It means that upgrading the "

"Backwards compatibility is very important to the FreeBSD team, and any "
"release in a major release series is expected to be able to run any "
"code—including kernel modules—that ran on an earlier version. The entire "
"base system is developed together, including the kernel, the core utilities, "
"and the configuration system, so upgrades are usually painless. Included "
"tools like mergemaster help update configuration files with little or no "
"manual intervention."

"FreeBSD has been one of the first adopters of the LLVM infrastructure, "

"system, including kernel and userspace, can build with clang, and from "
"FreeBSD both clang and the permissively-licensed libc++ are included, giving "
"a modern, BSD-licensed C++ stack. Several FreeBSD developers are also active "

"This same collaboration works downstream, with projects like GhostBSD, "

"FreeBSD and customize the system for specific uses."

msgid ""
"FreeBSD service initialization is very simple. Each service, whether part of "
"the base system or installed from a port, comes with a script that is "
"responsible for starting and stopping it (and often some other options). The "
"/etc/rc.conf file contains a list of variables for enabling and configuring "
"services. Want to enable ssh? Just add sshd_enable=\"YES\" to your rc.conf "
"file. This system makes it easy to see at a glance everything that will be "
"started when your system boots."

"The rc system that reads this file understands dependencies between services "

"The ports tree contains a large collection of third-party software, "

"Unlike some other systems, FreeBSD maintains a clean division between the "
"base system and third-party ports and packages. All third-party software "
